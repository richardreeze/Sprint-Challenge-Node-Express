1. What is Node?
Before 2009, you could only run JavaScript client-side (which I assume means in the browser).
Thanks to Node, you can now run JavaScript server-side too.

2. What is Express?
A NodeJS framework that allows you to build applications and APIs.

3. What is Middleware?
Everything that happens between your Express request and the final route (hence middle).

4. What is an endpoint?
It's also known as a URI. It's a path written in the URL.
